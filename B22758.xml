            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Extraordinary CASE,</head>
            <p>OF several Persons who did Advance, and Pay into the Receipt of His Majesties <hi>Exchequer,</hi> the Sum of 564,700 <hi>l.</hi> upon the Faith and Credit of an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> made in the Sixth and Seventh Years of His Majesties Reign, for Granting to His Majesty certain Rates and Duties on <hi>Stone, Glass,</hi> and <hi>Earthen Wares, Coals</hi> and <hi>Culm,</hi> for the Term of Five Years, for Carrying on the War against <hi>France;</hi> Impowering His Majesty to Borrow the said Summe at the Interest of 7 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> with a Clause in the said <hi>Act,</hi> That what should fall short, or be Deficient for Repayment of Principal and Interest in the Time limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, should be Transferred to, and made good out of the first Aids to be Granted to His Majesty by <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The very next <hi>Sessions of Parliament,</hi> the Duties on <hi>Stone, Glass,</hi> and <hi>Earthen Wares,</hi> was Appropriated for Establishing, <hi>A National Land-Bank;</hi> and the Duties on <hi>Coals</hi> and <hi>Culm</hi> were quite Taken away without the Consent of the Persons, who so Frankly Lent the said Summe; whereby they were totally Deprived of their Security, on which they depended when they parted with their Moneys on a Fund which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly would have fully Discharged the Principal and Interest in the Time granted, and were left destitute of any Interest for a Considerable Time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sessions of Parliament</hi> following, the aforesaid Matter was in an Humble Petition set forth to the <hi>Honourable House of Commons,</hi> wherein the Petitioners prayed to be Restored to their Security on which they Lent their Moneys; or else that some other <hi>Equivalent</hi> Security might be Granted instead thereof: Which Petition was referred to a Committee to Examine, and make their Report of the Matter <hi>Specially</hi> to the <hi>House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The said Committee did accordingly Examine it, and made their Report <hi>Specially,</hi> that all the Alligations therein were True.</p>
            <p>After which there were several Resolutions of the <hi>House,</hi> that <hi>Effectual</hi> Provision should be made for Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the said Debt and Interest.</p>
            <p>And it is Humbly Conceived the said <hi>Just Debt</hi> had been Secured out of several Funds, which at that Time were Ingrafted in the <hi>Bank of England</hi> till 1706, for Satisfying several Deficiencies; (and the rather) because a very short Time longer than 1706 (it's supposed) would fully and Honourably Discharge all.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Honourable House of Commons</hi> being Resolved to make <hi>Effectual</hi> Provision in Room of the <hi>Coals,</hi> &amp;c. and they being Informed that a Duty on <hi>Leather</hi> would produce a very Considerable Summe Yearly, these Tallies were Transferred to the Duty on <hi>Leather;</hi> whereby the Proprietors had not the good Fortune to be THEN made Ingraftable into the <hi>Bank:</hi> The Preamble of which <hi>Leather Act</hi> doth Express, <hi>That the Disappointment and Failure hath been very Injurious to the Lenders, and Prejudicial to the Publick Credit;</hi> with a Clause, That so much as shall fall short or Deficient for Repayment of the said Debt and Interest in the Time limited, shall be Transferred to, and Paid and Satisfied to the Lenders out of any of the next Aids or Supplies to be Granted to His Majesty by <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next <hi>Sessions of Parliament,</hi> which was in the Ninth and Tenth Years of His Majesties Reign, a Duty was Laid on <hi>Coals</hi> and <hi>Culm</hi> again, to Advance 500,000 <hi>l.</hi> more, which now Carries 8 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> Interest, at which Time the Persons who first Lent their Moneys on the said Duties, did offer their Humble Petition, setting forth the Insufficiency of the Duty on <hi>Leather,</hi> and praying to be Restored to part of their first Fund, the <hi>Coals</hi> and <hi>Culm</hi> again. <hi>But the Petition would not be Received.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duty on <hi>Leather</hi> is so very Inconsiderable, that it has not Paid off any Principal Moneys for about Fourteen Months past, and will Expire the 20th of <hi>April</hi> next: Whereby the Persons who Lent their Moneys (in the most Difficult Times for the Best of Purposes) will be Destitute of any Security for their so <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Just Debt.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>By all which Means the Petitioners have been very great Sufferers, and are still like to continue so, unless the Present <hi>Honourable House of Commons</hi> will either Restore them to their First Security, (part of which is Now a very Valuable Fund) or otherways will Please to make such <hi>Effectual</hi> Provision for the Repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the said <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Just Debt,</hi> and growing Interest, as in their GREAT WISDOM and JUSTICE they shall think REASONABLE.</q>
